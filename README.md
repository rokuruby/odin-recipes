<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
Welcome to odin-recipes, a simple HTML website created as a learning project for the Odin Project's Web Development course. This project is my first introduction to coding for web development and includes best practices learned from professional developers. It was created using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub.
